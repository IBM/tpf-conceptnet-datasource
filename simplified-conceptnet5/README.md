# Simplified ConceptNet5

The file contained in this folder represents the difference between Simplified and Vanilla versions of ConceptNet. Here we are calling the Vanilla version the one deployed at https://conceptnet.io/ from the [master branch on Github](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/tree/fda1b39607ea6f07e41ddce22d9d5f8360ded581). The Simplified version represents the modifications that were made, first, to allow this datasource to work and, second, to optimize access to ConceptNet data coming from the TPF Server equipped with this datasource.

More details on the implementation of this Simplified version can be found in the article: `coming soon`.
